# Node Module

## **Overview**

The Node Module is a crucial component of a larger system, designed to manage specific tasks such as job handling, resource allocation, health monitoring, and market interactions. It acts as an enabler, allowing nodes to interact effectively with job posters and the grid. The module focuses on simplifying workflows, ensuring secure operations, and maintaining efficiency, making it an indispensable part of the broader network infrastructure.

The `BasicNode` (`Node.ts`)class is the heart of the Node Module. It oversees the initialization and coordination of various components to ensure smooth operations.

The `BasicNode` class is composed of several critical components:

- **Handlers:** These modules manage specific functionalities, forming the backbone of the node's operations. They include:
    - `apiHandler`: Manages interactions with the API, ensuring job posters can communicate effectively with the node.
    - `runHandler`: Monitors and processes job runs, coordinating the entire execution flow.
    - `marketHandler`: Oversees interactions with the market, including queue management and market assignments.
    - `jobHandler`: Handles job execution, from claiming tasks to submitting results.
    - `benchmarkHandler`: Ensures the node's performance is up to standard by conducting pre-job system checks.
    - `expiryHandler`: Monitors and handles job expiration, ensuring timely cleanup and flow termination.
    - `healthHandler`: Conducts system health checks to verify readiness for tasks.
    - `keyHandler`: Manages access keys and facilitates secure communication.
    - `gridHandler`: Interfaces with the grid to manage onboarding, market recommendations, and node status updates.
- **Resource Management:** The `resourceManager` component dynamically fetches and allocates resources required for job execution, ensuring that nodes are never under-resourced.
- **Orchestration and Repository:** The `provider` manages communication with container orchestration tools such as Docker or Podman, while the `repository` interfaces with the database to store and retrieve node data.

The `BasicNode` class includes methods that handle core functionalities:

- **Core Operations:** The `start` method initializes container orchestration and performs health checks. The `stop` method gracefully terminates processes and cleans up resources.
- **Job Management:** The `run` method orchestrates the entire job lifecycle, including monitoring the job queue, claiming jobs, validating expiration, and submitting results. The `pending` method checks for unprocessed jobs, while the `queue` method ensures the node is properly aligned with the market queue.
- **Health and Maintenance:** Health checks are carried out via the `healthcheck` method to ensure system readiness. The `benchmark` method validates GPU performance before jobs are executed. Maintenance operations, such as clearing old job data, are handled by the `maintainance` method.
