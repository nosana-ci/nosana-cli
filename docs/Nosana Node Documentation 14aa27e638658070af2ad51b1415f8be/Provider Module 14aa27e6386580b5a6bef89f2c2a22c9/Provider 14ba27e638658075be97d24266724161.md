# Provider

**Provider Class(`Provider.ts`)**

This is the class that connects the node with the container orchestration technology, this class houses the communication and tasks that our node wants this technology to implement which includes creating images, starting containers with networks and volumes, with also some preset flows. this provider class uses [`ContainerOrchestrationInterface`](ContainerOrchestrationInterface%2014ba27e63865803e98a6c72646f41888.md) , [`NodeRepository`](../Repository%20Module%2014aa27e63865801985c1c8fe3b23bde1/NodeRepository%2014ba27e63865801692e3d2c4a479d6c8.md) and `ResourceManager` .

- `containerOrchestration`: Interface for managing container orchestration operations.
- `repository`: Tracks and manages flow and operation states, stores logs and errors of the flow.
- `resourceManager`: Handles resource allocation and volume management.

# Implementations

### **1. Reverse Proxy Management**

### `setUpReverseProxyApi(address: string): Promise<boolean>`

- **Purpose**: Sets up a reverse proxy for the containerized API.
- **Steps**:
    - Creates a dedicated network.
    - Pulls required images (`frpc` and `tunnel`).
    - Configures and starts `tunnel` and `frpc` containers.
- **Returns**: `true` if successful.

### `stopReverseProxyApi(address: string): Promise<boolean>`

- **Purpose**: Cleans up resources associated with a reverse proxy.
- **Steps**:
    - Stops and deletes `tunnel` and `frpc` containers if they exist.
    - Deletes the associated network.
- **Returns**: `true` if successful.

### **2. Container Operations**

### `containerRunOperation(id: string, index: number): Promise<boolean>`

- **Purpose**: Runs a container operation as defined in the workflow.
- **Steps**:
    - Pulls the container image if not present.
    - Starts the container with the specified parameters (e.g., volumes, environment variables, networks).
    - Streams logs and tracks execution status.
    - Supports exposing services using a reverse proxy (`frpc`).
- **Returns**: `true` if the container runs successfully, otherwise `false`.

### `containerRunStopOperation(id: string, index: number): Promise<boolean>`

- **Purpose**: Stops and removes containers and associated networks created by a `containerRunOperation`.
- **Returns**: `true` if successful.

### **3. Volume Management**

### `volumeCreateOperation(id: string, index: number): Promise<boolean>`

- **Purpose**: Creates a persistent volume for container storage.
- **Steps**:
    - Checks if the volume exists.
    - Creates a new volume if required.
- **Returns**: `true` if successful, otherwise `false`.

### `volumeStopOperation(id: string, index: number): Promise<boolean>`

- **Purpose**: Deletes a volume associated with an operation.
- **Returns**: `true` if successful.

### **4. Health Check**

### `startServiceExposedUrlHealthCheck(id: string, container: Dockerode.Container, port: number)`

- **Purpose**: Periodically verifies the availability of a service exposed on a containerâ€™s port.
- **Steps**:
    - Executes health check commands within the container.
    - Emits an event once the service is available.
