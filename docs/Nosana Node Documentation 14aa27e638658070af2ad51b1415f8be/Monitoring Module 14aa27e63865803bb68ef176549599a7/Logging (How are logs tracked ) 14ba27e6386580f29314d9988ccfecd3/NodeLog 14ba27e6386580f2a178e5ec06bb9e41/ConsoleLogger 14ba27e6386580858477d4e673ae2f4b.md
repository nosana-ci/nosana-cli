# ConsoleLogger

`ConsoleLogger.ts`

## Overview

The `ConsoleLogger` class is an implementation that manages console-based logging, with capabilities for observing log changes, spinning indicators, and managing progress bars. It follows the Observer pattern by listening to updates from [`NodeLog`](../NodeLog%2014ba27e6386580f2a178e5ec06bb9e41.md) and controlling the flow of logging activities.

## Structure

- `consoleLogging`: A singleton pattern used to ensure there is only one instance of `ConsoleLogger` at any given time. It creates and initializes the logger instance only when needed.
- `ConsoleLogger`: Implements the `LogObserver` interface, listens to log entries, and provides various utilities to represent different types of logs.

### Key Dependencies

- `ora`: Used for providing spinner-based console logging.
- `cli-progress`: Utilized for creating and managing progress bars.
- `chalk`: Allows customization of the console text with different colors and styles.
- `NodeLog` and `LogObserver`: Log manager and Observer classes that `ConsoleLogger` interacts with.

## Singleton: `consoleLogging`

This pattern ensures that only a single instance of `ConsoleLogger` is active.

- `instance: ConsoleLogger | null`: Holds a reference to the single `ConsoleLogger` instance.
- Returns the existing instance if it exists, otherwise creates one and initializes it.

## ConsoleLogger Class

### Fields and Properties

- `pending: boolean`: Tracks if there is a pending log or an operation in progress.
- `expecting: string | undefined`: Stores the expected method or log type that is awaited.
- `progressBar: SingleBar | undefined`: Holds the current progress bar instance, if any.
- `running: boolean`: Tracks if the logger is currently running.
- `spinner: Ora`: The spinner instance used for active tasks.

### Constructor

- Initializes the `ConsoleLogger` class without parameters.

### Method: `addObserver()`

- Adds the `ConsoleLogger` as an observer to the `log()` object from `NodeLog`.

### Method: `update(log: NodeLogEntry, isNode: boolean = true)`

The `update()` method acts as a handler for various log types and manages log updates to the console.

### Parameters:

- `log: NodeLogEntry`: The log entry containing information on log type, job, payload, etc.
- `isNode: boolean = true`: Indicates whether the log entry is node-specific.

### Log Handling

1. **Job Logs (`log.job && isNode`)**
    - Stops any current spinner.
    - Starts a new spinner indicating the current job.
2. **Standard Logs (`log.type == 'log'`)**
    - Writes standard logs directly to `stdout` if not related to a node.
3. **Progress Bar Start (`log.type == 'process-bar-start'`)**
    - Stops any active spinner and progress bar.
    - Initializes a new progress bar using `SingleBar`.
    - Starts the progress bar based on payload values like `total`, `startValue`, etc.
4. **Progress Bar Update (`log.type == 'process-bar-update'`)**
    - Updates the progress bar with current values.
5. **Progress Bar Stop (`log.type == 'process-bar-stop'`)**
    - Stops the active progress bar and resets it.
6. **Update Pending Spinner (`this.pending`)**
    - Handles updates to the spinner text (`log.type == 'update'`), stops spinners (`log.type == 'stop'`), or logs success/error messages.
    - Uses `ora` to update the spinner text or mark success/failure depending on the log type.
7. **Pending Operations (`log.pending?.isPending`)**
    - When a new pending operation is encountered, a new spinner is started with the appropriate message (`log.log`).

## Log Types Explained

- **`log`**: Represents general logging to the console, typically text output.
- **`job`**: Indicates the current job being executed; displayed using a spinner.
- **`process-bar-start`**: Used to initialize and start a progress bar.
- **`process-bar-update`**: Updates the value of the current progress bar.
- **`process-bar-stop`**: Stops and removes the progress bar.
- **`update`**: Updates the text of the current spinner, generally for pending operations.
- **`add`**: Outputs a simple log message to the console.
- **`error`**: Indicates an error that occurred, stopping the spinner and outputting an error message.
- **`stop`**: Stops the current spinner and optionally outputs a log message.
- **`success`**: Marks the spinner as successful and stops it.
- **`pending`**: Indicates a pending operation, starting a spinner to represent the ongoing process.

## Usage Example

To use `ConsoleLogger`, simply invoke `consoleLogging()` to get the singleton instance and begin observing logs:

```tsx
const logger = consoleLogging();

```

After invoking, the logger will automatically handle and display logs based on updates received from `NodeLog`.
