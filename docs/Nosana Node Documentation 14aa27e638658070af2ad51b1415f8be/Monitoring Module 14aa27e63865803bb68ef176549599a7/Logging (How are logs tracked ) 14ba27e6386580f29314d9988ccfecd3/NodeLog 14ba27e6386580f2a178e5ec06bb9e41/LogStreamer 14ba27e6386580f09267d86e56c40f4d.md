# LogStreamer

`LogStreamer.ts`

## Overview

The `LogStreamer` class is an implementation that manages log streaming over WebSocket connections. It follows the Observer pattern by listening to updates from [`NodeLog`](../NodeLog%2014ba27e6386580f2a178e5ec06bb9e41.md) and streaming logs to WebSocket clients. This allows for real-time monitoring of log entries by multiple clients.

## Structure

- `logStreaming`: A singleton pattern used to ensure there is only one instance of `LogStreamer` per node. It creates and initializes the log streaming instance only when needed.
- `LogStreamer`: Implements the `LogObserver` interface, listens to log entries, and streams them to WebSocket clients.

### Key Dependencies

- `ws`: WebSocket library used for managing real-time communication.
- `NodeLog` and `LogObserver`: Log manager and Observer classes that `LogStreamer` interacts with.

## Singleton: `logStreaming`

This pattern ensures that only a single instance of `LogStreamer` is active per node.

- `instance: LogStreamer | null`: Holds a reference to the single `LogStreamer` instance for a node.
- Returns the existing instance if it exists, otherwise creates one and initializes it.

## LogStreamer Class

### Fields and Properties

- `logs: Map<string, string[]>`: Stores logs for different jobs and for all logs (`'all'`).
- `index: number`: Tracks the number of log entries received.
- `clients: Map<string, WebSocket[]>`: Maintains a list of WebSocket clients subscribed to each job.

### Constructor

- `constructor(privatenode: string)`: Initializes the `LogStreamer` with a specific node and adds it as an observer to the `log()` object.

### Method: `update(log: NodeLogEntry)`

The `update()` method acts as a handler for log entries and streams them to WebSocket clients.

### Parameters:

- `log: NodeLogEntry`: The log entry containing information on log type, job, payload, etc.

### Log Handling

1. **Log Message Generation**
    - Converts the log entry to a JSON string.
    - Increments the log index.
2. **Job-Specific Logs**
    - If the log contains a job, adds the log to the corresponding job in the `logs` map.
    - Sends the log message to all WebSocket clients subscribed to the specific job.
3. **General Logs (`'all'`)**
    - Adds the log to the `'all'` key in the `logs` map.

### Method: `subscribe(ws: WebSocket, job: string)`

Allows a WebSocket client to subscribe to log updates for a specific job.

### Parameters:

- `ws: WebSocket`: The WebSocket client subscribing to the logs.
- `job: string`: The job for which the client wants to receive logs.

### Subscription Handling

- Adds the WebSocket client to the list of clients for the specified job.
- Sends all existing logs for the job to the newly subscribed client.

### Method: `unsubscribe(ws: WebSocket)`

Allows a WebSocket client to unsubscribe from log updates.

### Parameters:

- `ws: WebSocket`: The WebSocket client unsubscribing from the logs.

### Unsubscription Handling

- Removes the WebSocket client from all job subscriptions.
- If no clients remain for a job, deletes the job entry from the `clients` map.

## Usage Example

To use `LogStreamer`, simply invoke `logStreaming(node)` to get the singleton instance for a specific node and begin observing logs:

```
const logStreamer = logStreaming('node1');
```

After invoking, `logStreamer` will automatically handle and stream logs to connected WebSocket clients based on updates received from `NodeLog`.
