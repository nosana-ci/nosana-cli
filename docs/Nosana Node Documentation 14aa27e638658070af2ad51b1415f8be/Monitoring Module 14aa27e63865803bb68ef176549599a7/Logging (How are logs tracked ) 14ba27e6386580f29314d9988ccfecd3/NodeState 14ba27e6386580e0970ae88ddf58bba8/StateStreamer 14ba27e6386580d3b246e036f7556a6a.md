# StateStreamer

`StateStreamer.ts`

## Overview

The `StateStreamer` class is responsible for managing the streaming of node state updates over WebSocket connections. It implements the `StateObserver` interface to receive state updates from `NodeState` and forwards these updates to subscribed WebSocket clients in real-time.

## Singleton Pattern

The `StateStreamer` class uses a singleton pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of `StateStreamer` per node throughout the application. The `stateStreaming()` function returns this single instance, maintaining consistent state streaming across different parts of the system.

- **Instance**: The singleton instance is held by `StateStreamer | null`. If no instance exists, a new one is created and returned.
- **Usage**: The singleton ensures that all operations related to state streaming for a specific node are consistent and managed through the same instance.

## Managing WebSocket Clients

The `StateStreamer` class allows multiple WebSocket clients to subscribe to state updates. Clients can subscribe to updates for a specific job or all jobs, enabling real-time monitoring of node states.

### Client Management Functions

- **`subscribe(ws: WebSocket, job: string)`**: Subscribes a WebSocket client to receive updates for a specific job.
- **`unsubscribe(ws: WebSocket)`**: Unsubscribes a WebSocket client from receiving further updates.
- **`update(status: string, state: { [key: string]: string }, timestamp: number)`**: Notifies all subscribed clients of a state update.

## Fields and Properties

- **`states: Map<string, string[]>`**: Stores state messages for different jobs and for all jobs (`'all'`).
- **`index: number`**: Tracks the number of state updates received.
- **`clients: Map<string, WebSocket[]>`**: Maintains a list of WebSocket clients subscribed to each job.

## Constructor

- **`constructor(node: string)`**: Initializes the `StateStreamer` instance for a specific node and adds it as an observer to the `NodeState` instance for that node.

## State Streaming Methods

### `update(status: string, state: { [key: string]: string }, timestamp: number)`

Handles state updates from `NodeState` and streams them to all subscribed WebSocket clients.

- **Parameters**:
    - `status: string`: The current status of the node.
    - `state: { [key: string]: string }`: The current state information of the node.
    - `timestamp: number`: The timestamp when the state change occurred.

### State Handling Workflow

1. **State Message Creation**: Converts the state information to a JSON string, including the status, state, timestamp, and update index.
2. **Job-Specific State Updates**: If the state contains a job, adds the state message to the corresponding job in the `states` map and sends it to all subscribed clients.
3. **General State Updates (`'all'`)**: Adds the state message to the `'all'` key in the `states` map.

### `subscribe(ws: WebSocket, job: string)`

Subscribes a WebSocket client to receive state updates for a specific job.

- **Parameters**:
    - `ws: WebSocket`: The WebSocket client subscribing to the state updates.
    - `job: string`: The job for which the client wants to receive updates.

### Subscription Handling

- Adds the WebSocket client to the list of clients for the specified job.
- Sends all existing state messages for the job to the newly subscribed client.

### `unsubscribe(ws: WebSocket)`

Unsubscribes a WebSocket client from receiving state updates.

- **Parameters**: `ws: WebSocket` - The WebSocket client unsubscribing from the state updates.

### Unsubscription Handling

- Removes the WebSocket client from all job subscriptions.
- If no clients remain for a job, deletes the job entry from the `clients` map.

## Using the StateStreamer Class

Hereâ€™s how to use the `StateStreamer` class in your code:

```tsx
const stateStreamer = stateStreaming('node1');
```

After invoking, `StateStreamer` will automatically manage state updates for the specified node and stream them to connected WebSocket clients based on the updates received from `NodeState`.

## Extending StateStreamer

To extend the functionality of the `StateStreamer` class:

- **Add New Clients**: New WebSocket clients can subscribe to receive state updates using the `subscribe()` method.
- **Modify State Structure**: Update the `state` object or extend the `StateStreamer` class if more information needs to be tracked or included in the state updates.

## Key Features

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance per node to manage state streaming efficiently.
- **Observer Pattern**: Implements the `StateObserver` interface to receive state updates from `NodeState`.
- **Real-Time State Streaming**: Streams state updates to WebSocket clients in real time, supporting monitoring of specific jobs or all jobs.
- **Client Management**: Manages the subscription and unsubscription of WebSocket clients to ensure efficient use of resources.
