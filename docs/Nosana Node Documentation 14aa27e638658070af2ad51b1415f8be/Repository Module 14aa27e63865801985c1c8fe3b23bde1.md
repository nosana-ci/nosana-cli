# Repository Module

## Overview

The `repository` module is a critical component of the Node system, designed to manage and persist data across different operations. It acts as an interface for interacting with the database, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and updates. This module ensures that the state of the Node, including flows, resources, and logs, is maintained consistently.
