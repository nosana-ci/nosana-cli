# Flowhandler

`flowHandler.ts`

The `FlowHandler` class manages the lifecycle of flows in the Nosana ecosystem. It handles flow initialization, execution, state management, and cleanup, ensuring that operations are executed in the correct order and that their results are accurately recorded. By integrating with the `Provider` and `NodeRepository` classes, it provides robust tools for managing jobs and their associated flows.
