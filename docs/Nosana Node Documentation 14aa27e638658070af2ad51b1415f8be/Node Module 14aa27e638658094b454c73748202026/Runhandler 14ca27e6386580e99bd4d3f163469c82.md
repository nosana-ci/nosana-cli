# Runhandler

`runHandler.ts`

The `RunHandler` class is a critical component for managing job runs within the Nosana ecosystem. It facilitates monitoring, retrieving, and managing the lifecycle of job runs. By providing methods to interact with runs in real-time, this class ensures that nodes remain updated and can handle changes effectively.

## **Core Responsibilities**

1. **Run Management**
    - Retrieve and update the current run.
    - Clear or stop the current run when necessary.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**
    - Monitor job runs in real-time using program account subscriptions.
    - Notify with updates whenever a change in run status occurs.
3. **Error Handling**
    - Handle errors during run retrieval and monitoring to ensure reliability.
4. **Integration with Nosana SDK**
    - Use the Nosana SDK to interact with the Solana blockchain for run-related operations.
