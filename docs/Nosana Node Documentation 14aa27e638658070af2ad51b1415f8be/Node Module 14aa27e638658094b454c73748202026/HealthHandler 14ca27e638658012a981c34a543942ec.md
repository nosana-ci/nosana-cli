# HealthHandler

`healthHandler.ts`

The `HealthHandler` class ensures that all necessary components for a node are in proper working condition before the node interacts with a market. It performs a comprehensive health check on the node's balance, staking status, market access, and container orchestration setup. By integrating various handlers such as the `KeyHandler` for managing access keys, the `MarketHandler` for validating markets, and the `StakeHandler` for staking requirements, the `HealthHandler` facilitates a seamless and secure process for node validation and readiness.

## **Core Responsibilities**

1. **Market Validation**
    - Verifies that the specified market exists and can be joined.
2. **Balance Verification**
    - Ensures that the node's balance is sufficient for operations.
3. **Staking Validation**
    - Checks if the node meets the staking requirements for the market.
    - Prompts the user to top up stakes if necessary.
4. **Access Key Validation**
    - Checks if the market requires an access key and retrieves it from the blockchain if needed.
5. **Container Orchestration Health Check**
    - Ensures the container orchestration tool (Docker or Podman) is operational.
