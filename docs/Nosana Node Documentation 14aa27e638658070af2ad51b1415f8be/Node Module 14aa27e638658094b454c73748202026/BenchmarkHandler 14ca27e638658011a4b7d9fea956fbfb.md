# BenchmarkHandler

`benchmarkHandler.ts`

 

The `BenchmarkHandler` class is responsible for validating a node's readiness by performing benchmark tests on the GPU and checking available disk space. By integrating with the `FlowHandler` and leveraging the Nosana ecosystem, the `BenchmarkHandler` ensures nodes meet the minimum requirements for participating in network tasks. It processes results from these benchmarks and updates node information accordingly.

## **Core Responsibilities**

1. **GPU Benchmarking**
    - Validates GPU configurations and performance by running a CUDA-based benchmark.
2. **Disk Space Validation**
    - Checks available disk space to ensure it meets the required minimum.
3. **Result Processing**
    - Processes benchmark outputs to determine success or failure.
    - Updates node information based on results.
4. **Error Handling**
    - Handles errors related to benchmark failures and insufficient resources.
