# BalanceHandler

`balanceHandler.ts`

The `BalanceHandler` class is responsible for managing and validating a node's balances in the Nosana ecosystem. It ensures that a node's SOL and NOS token balances meet the minimum requirements for operation. By providing methods to fetch and verify balances, the `BalanceHandler` ensures smooth functionality and helps nodes maintain readiness for network interactions.

## **Core Responsibilities**

1. **Balance Retrieval**
    - Fetches the current SOL and NOS token balances for the node.
2. **Balance Validation**
    - Ensures the SOL balance meets the minimum required threshold.
3. **NOS Token Balance Access**
    - Provides access to the current NOS token balance for other components.
