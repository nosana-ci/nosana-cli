# KeyHandler

`keyHandler.ts`

The `KeyHandler` class is part of the Node Module system, designed to manage the access keys and market associations required for a node to participate in specific job markets. It interacts with the Solana blockchain to retrieve, store, and validate access keys, ensuring secure communication between the node and the backend systems. Additionally, it facilitates the onboarding process for nodes and validates their readiness to operate within assigned markets.
