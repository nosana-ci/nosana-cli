# NodeRepository

**NodeRepository (`NodeRepository.ts`)**

The **`NodeRepository`** module centralizes all database interactions within the Node system. It ensures that all data-related operations such as managing flows, operational states, resources, and Node metadata are handled in a single, well-organized location. By consolidating these interactions, the `NodeRepository` class simplifies database management, enhances maintainability, and reduces the risk of duplicate or inconsistent operations.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `NodeRepository` is to:

1. **Centralize Database Interactions**: All database operations are consolidated into a single class, avoiding scattered logic and ensuring consistency.
2. **Simplify Future Enhancements**: Any new database interactions can be added here, ensuring a single source of truth for managing the database.
3. **Maintain Data Consistency**: By using this centralized approach, the `NodeRepository` ensures that updates and queries are applied uniformly across the Node system.
4. **Encourage Reusability**: The repository provides reusable methods for common database operations, reducing code duplication and simplifying development.

## Usage

```tsx
const repository = new NodeRepository(dbInstance);

// Add or update a flow
repository.setflow('flow1', {
  id: 'flow1',
  state: { opStates: [], secrets: {}, errors: [] },
});
```
